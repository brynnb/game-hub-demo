# Game Hub Demo

This is a project I used to refamiliarize myself with React and TypeScript alongside an online course I was following. There's not much value to it being on github, but I like seeing green squares on my commit history, so here we are. 

Features include:

* Filtering by platform and genre
* Sorting
* Pulling data from rawg.io API
* Search
* Dark mode
* Responsive design

Libaries used:
* React
* React Query
* Axios
* React Router
* Zustand
* Misc stuff for emojis/icons/styling/date calcs/etc
